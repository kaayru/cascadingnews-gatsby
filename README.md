# Cascading News

**Cascading News** is a website whose purpose is to provide the latest news and tutorials on frontend development.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The website is on the process of being remade.
>
> - Old site for reference: https://www.cascading-news.com
> - New site on Netlify: https://app.netlify.com/sites/condescending-perlman-298bba/deploys

## üöÄ How it's built

This site is built using **WordPress** for the backend, **Gatsby + React** for the statically generated frontend, and **Netlify** for awesome hosting and CI.

My challenge when building this site was to make it as automatic as possible.

2. Create a **Feature branch** from `develop`
3. **Commit** changes to this branch
4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes and merge it

### ‚öõÔ∏è **Set up**

If you want to contribute to the frontend code, here's how to set up the project locally.

1. **Checkout this project**
2. **Create `.env.development` containing:**
   ```shell
   GATSBY_WP_URL=cascading-news.com
   GATSBY_WP_PROTOCOL=https
   GATSBY_REPLACEMENT_URL=http://localhost:8000

3. **Install the Gatsby CLI**
   ```
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```
4. **Start the site in `develop` mode.**
